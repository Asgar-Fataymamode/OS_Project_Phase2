## Architecture and Design

### System Architecture Overview

Phase 2 extends the Phase 1 local shell into a distributed client-server architecture using TCP socket communication. The system consists of three main components:

1. **Server (Person A)** - Receives commands from clients, executes them using Phase 1 shell implementation, and returns output
2. **Client (Person B)** - Provides user interface, sends commands to server, displays results
3. **Phase 1 Shell Core** - Reused command parsing and execution engine (`shell_utils.c/h`)
```

### Server-Side Architecture (Person A)

The server implementation consists of several key modules:

#### 1. Socket Management Module
- **Purpose:** Handle TCP socket creation, binding, listening, and accepting connections
- **Components:**
  - `create_server_socket()` - Creates and configures TCP socket
  - `accept_client_connection()` - Accepts incoming client connections
- **Design Decision:** Used `SO_REUSEADDR` socket option to prevent "address already in use" errors when restarting the server during development and testing

#### 2. Command Reception Module
- **Purpose:** Receive commands from connected clients
- **Components:**
  - `handle_client()` - Main command loop
- **Buffer Size:** 4096 bytes (sufficient for typical shell commands)
- **Protocol:** Newline-terminated strings for command transmission

#### 3. Command Execution Module
- **Purpose:** Execute commands and capture their output
- **Components:**
  - `execute_command_with_capture()` - Core execution engine
- **Design Decision:** This is the most critical design decision in the server implementation

#### 4. Output Capture Mechanism (Critical Design Decision)

**Problem:** Need to capture stdout and stderr from Phase 1 command execution to send back to client

**Solution Chosen:** Pipe-based output capture with fork()

**Implementation:**
1. Create two pipes: one for stdout, one for stderr
2. Fork a child process
3. In child: Redirect stdout/stderr to pipe write ends using `dup2()`
4. In child: Execute command using Phase 1 `parse_pipeline()` and `execute_pipeline()`
5. In parent: Read from pipe read ends to capture all output
6. In parent: Wait for child to complete, then return captured output

**Why This Approach:**
- ✅ Captures all output including from pipes, redirections, and errors
- ✅ Non-blocking - parent can read output as child produces it
- ✅ Preserves Phase 1 code completely (no modifications needed)
- ✅ Handles multi-line output correctly
- ✅ Separates stdout and stderr (can be combined or sent separately)

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **System() with popen():** Rejected because it doesn't integrate with Phase 1 code directly
- **Temporary files:** Rejected because it's slower and requires filesystem I/O
- **Direct modification of Phase 1:** Rejected to maintain Phase 1 code integrity

#### 5. Display/Logging Module
- **Purpose:** Display formatted messages on server console
- **Components:**
  - `print_info()` - Informational messages
  - `print_received()` - Display received commands
  - `print_executing()` - Display command being executed
  - `print_output()` - Output header
  - `print_error()` - Error messages
- **Format:** Matches assignment requirements exactly

### Key Design Decisions

#### Decision 1: Single-Client Architecture
**Decision:** Server handles one client at a time (no multi-threading)  
**Rationale:**
- Phase 2 requirements don't specify multi-client support
- Simpler implementation and debugging
- Sufficient for assignment requirements
- Can be extended to multi-client in future phases if needed

#### Decision 2: Port Number (8080)
**Decision:** Hardcoded port 8080  
**Rationale:**
- Assignment specified hardcoded port
- Port 8080 is commonly used for development
- Above 1024 (no root privileges required)
- Easy to remember for testing

#### Decision 3: Protocol Design
**Decision:** Simple text-based protocol with newline-terminated commands  
**Rationale:**
- Simple to implement and debug
- Compatible with testing tools (nc, telnet)
- Human-readable for debugging
- Sufficient for shell command transmission
- No need for complex serialization

#### Decision 4: Dynamic Memory Allocation for Output
**Decision:** Dynamically grow output buffer using `realloc()`  
**Rationale:**
- Handle commands with arbitrary output length
- Efficient memory usage (start small, grow as needed)
- Prevents buffer overflow
- Handles edge cases (large file listings, verbose commands)

#### Decision 5: Phase 1 Code Reuse
**Decision:** Reuse Phase 1 `shell_utils.c/h` without modification  
**Rationale:**
- Avoid code duplication
- Maintain consistency with Phase 1 behavior
- Easier testing (same execution logic)
- Separation of concerns (networking vs. execution)

### Data Structures

No new data structures were needed for the server. The server reuses Phase 1 data structures:
- `command_t` - Represents a single command
- `pipeline_t` - Represents a pipeline of commands
- `error_type_t` - Error type enumeration

### Algorithm: Command Execution with Output Capture
```
Algorithm: execute_command_with_capture(command)
Input: command string (e.g., "ls -l")
Output: captured output string, success flag

1. Create stdout_pipe and stderr_pipe
2. Fork a child process
3. IF child process:
   a. Close read ends of pipes
   b. Redirect STDOUT to stdout_pipe write end
   c. Redirect STDERR to stderr_pipe write end
   d. Close original pipe write ends
   e. Copy command string
   f. Parse command using parse_pipeline()
   g. Execute pipeline using execute_pipeline()
   h. Exit with command's exit status
4. ELSE (parent process):
   a. Close write ends of pipes
   b. Allocate initial output buffer
   c. WHILE data available from stdout_pipe:
      i. Read chunk from pipe
      ii. If buffer full, realloc to double size
      iii. Append chunk to output buffer
   d. WHILE data available from stderr_pipe:
      i. Read chunk from pipe
      ii. If buffer full, realloc to double size
      iii. Append chunk to output buffer
   e. Close read ends of pipes
   f. Wait for child process to complete
   g. Determine success based on exit status
   h. Return output buffer
5. END
```

## Implementation Highlights

### Core Functionalities

#### 1. Socket Initialization and Configuration

**Function:** `create_server_socket()`
```c
int create_server_socket(void) {
    int server_fd;
    struct sockaddr_in server_addr;
    int opt = 1;
    
    // Create TCP socket
    server_fd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
    
    // Set SO_REUSEADDR to avoid "address already in use"
    setsockopt(server_fd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR, &opt, sizeof(opt));
    
    // Configure address structure
    server_addr.sin_family = AF_INET;
    server_addr.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY;
    server_addr.sin_port = htons(PORT);
    
    // Bind and listen
    bind(server_fd, (struct sockaddr *)&server_addr, sizeof(server_addr));
    listen(server_fd, BACKLOG);
    
    return server_fd;
}
```

**Key Points:**
- `AF_INET` - IPv4 protocol
- `SOCK_STREAM` - TCP (connection-oriented, reliable)
- `INADDR_ANY` - Accept connections on any network interface
- `htons()` - Convert port to network byte order (big-endian)
- `SO_REUSEADDR` - Critical for development (allows immediate restart)

#### 2. Command Execution with Output Capture

**Function:** `execute_command_with_capture()`

**Critical Code Snippet:**
```c
char* execute_command_with_capture(const char* command, int* success) {
    int stdout_pipe[2], stderr_pipe[2];
    
    // Create pipes for capturing output
    pipe(stdout_pipe);
    pipe(stderr_pipe);
    
    pid_t pid = fork();
    
    if (pid == 0) {
        // CHILD PROCESS: Execute command with redirected output
        
        // Close read ends (child only writes)
        close(stdout_pipe[0]);
        close(stderr_pipe[0]);
        
        // Redirect stdout and stderr to pipes
        dup2(stdout_pipe[1], STDOUT_FILENO);
        dup2(stderr_pipe[1], STDERR_FILENO);
        
        // Close original pipe descriptors
        close(stdout_pipe[1]);
        close(stderr_pipe[1]);
        
        // Execute using Phase 1 code
        char* cmd_copy = malloc(strlen(command) + 1);
        strcpy(cmd_copy, command);
        
        pipeline_t* pipeline = parse_pipeline(cmd_copy);
        free(cmd_copy);
        
        int status = execute_pipeline(pipeline);
        free_pipeline(pipeline);
        
        exit(status);  // Exit with command's status
        
    } else {
        // PARENT PROCESS: Capture output from pipes
        
        // Close write ends (parent only reads)
        close(stdout_pipe[1]);
        close(stderr_pipe[1]);
        
        // Allocate dynamic buffer for output
        size_t total_size = BUFFER_SIZE * 2;
        char* output = malloc(total_size);
        output[0] = '\0';
        size_t output_len = 0;
        
        // Read all stdout
        char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];
        ssize_t bytes;
        while ((bytes = read(stdout_pipe[0], buffer, BUFFER_SIZE - 1)) > 0) {
            buffer[bytes] = '\0';
            
            // Grow buffer if needed
            while (output_len + bytes + 1 > total_size) {
                total_size *= 2;
                output = realloc(output, total_size);
            }
            
            strcat(output, buffer);
            output_len += bytes;
        }
        
        // Read all stderr (similar logic)
        while ((bytes = read(stderr_pipe[0], buffer, BUFFER_SIZE - 1)) > 0) {
            // ... same as stdout reading ...
        }
        
        // Cleanup and wait for child
        close(stdout_pipe[0]);
        close(stderr_pipe[0]);
        
        int status;
        waitpid(pid, &status, 0);
        
        // Determine success
        *success = (WIFEXITED(status) && WEXITSTATUS(status) == 0);
        
        return output;  // Caller must free
    }
}
```

**Implementation Details:**
- **Dynamic Buffer Growth:** Starts with 8KB (BUFFER_SIZE * 2), doubles when full
- **Separate Pipes:** stdout and stderr are captured separately, then combined
- **Exit Status Checking:** Uses `WIFEXITED()` and `WEXITSTATUS()` macros
- **Memory Management:** Caller is responsible for freeing returned string
- **Error Detection:** Checks for "Command not found" in output to set success flag

**Why This Works:**
1. Fork isolates command execution from server process
2. Pipes provide IPC mechanism for output capture
3. `dup2()` redirects file descriptors transparently to Phase 1 code
4. Parent reads from pipes after child writes (no deadlock)
5. Dynamic allocation handles arbitrary output sizes

#### 3. Client Command Handling Loop

**Function:** `handle_client()`
```c
void handle_client(int client_fd) {
    char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];
    ssize_t bytes_received;
    
    while (1) {
        // Receive command from client
        bytes_received = recv(client_fd, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE - 1, 0);
        
        // Check for disconnect
        if (bytes_received <= 0) {
            printf("[INFO] Client disconnected.\n");
            break;
        }
        
        // Null-terminate and strip newline
        buffer[bytes_received] = '\0';
        if (buffer[strlen(buffer) - 1] == '\n') {
            buffer[strlen(buffer) - 1] = '\0';
        }
        
        // Log received command
        print_received(buffer);
        
        // Handle exit
        if (strcmp(buffer, "exit") == 0) {
            send(client_fd, "", 0, 0);  // Acknowledge
            break;
        }
        
        // Execute command
        print_executing(buffer);
        int success = 0;
        char* output = execute_command_with_capture(buffer, &success);
        
        // Display and send output
        if (output != NULL) {
            if (success) {
                print_output("Sending output to client:");
                printf("%s", output);
            } else {
                printf("[ERROR] Command not found: \"%s\"\n", buffer);
                print_output("Sending error message to client:");
                printf("%s", output);
            }
            
            send(client_fd, output, strlen(output), 0);
            free(output);
        }
    }
}
```

**Key Features:**
- **Blocking recv():** Waits for client commands (appropriate for single-client)
- **Graceful Disconnect:** Detects when client closes connection (recv returns 0)
- **Protocol Compliance:** Strips newline as per protocol specification
- **Error Handling:** Distinguishes between successful commands and errors
- **Memory Safety:** Always frees dynamically allocated output

#### 4. Server Console Output Formatting

**Functions:** `print_info()`, `print_received()`, `print_executing()`, `print_output()`, `print_error()`

**Example:**
```c
void print_received(const char* command) {
    printf("[RECEIVED] Received command: \"%s\" from client.\n", command);
    fflush(stdout);
}

void print_executing(const char* command) {
    printf("[EXECUTING] Executing command: \"%s\"\n", command);
    fflush(stdout);
}
```

**Design Notes:**
- **Consistent Format:** All messages follow `[TAG] message` format
- **Flushing:** `fflush(stdout)` ensures immediate display (important for logging)
- **Quoted Commands:** Commands are displayed in quotes for clarity
- **Server-Side Only:** These messages are NOT sent to client

### Error Handling

#### 1. Socket Creation Errors
```c
if (server_fd == -1) {
    perror("Error: Socket creation failed");
    return -1;
}
```
- **Handles:** Permission issues, system resource limits
- **Recovery:** Returns error to main, which exits gracefully

#### 2. Bind Errors
```c
if (bind(server_fd, ...) == -1) {
    perror("Error: Bind failed");
    close(server_fd);
    return -1;
}
```
- **Handles:** Port already in use, permission denied
- **Recovery:** Closes socket before returning error
- **Note:** `SO_REUSEADDR` minimizes "address already in use" errors

#### 3. Fork Failures
```c
if (pid == -1) {
    perror("Error: fork failed");
    close(stdout_pipe[0]);
    close(stdout_pipe[1]);
    close(stderr_pipe[0]);
    close(stderr_pipe[1]);
    *success = 0;
    return NULL;
}
```
- **Handles:** System resource exhaustion
- **Recovery:** Closes all pipe descriptors, returns NULL
- **Cleanup:** Ensures no file descriptor leaks

#### 4. Pipe Creation Errors
```c
if (pipe(stdout_pipe) == -1) {
    perror("Error: pipe creation failed");
    *success = 0;
    return NULL;
}
```
- **Handles:** System file descriptor limit reached
- **Recovery:** Returns NULL immediately

#### 5. Memory Allocation Errors
```c
char* output = malloc(total_size);
if (output == NULL) {
    perror("Error: malloc failed");
    close(stdout_pipe[0]);
    close(stderr_pipe[0]);
    waitpid(pid, NULL, 0);
    *success = 0;
    return NULL;
}
```
- **Handles:** Out of memory condition
- **Recovery:** Closes pipes, waits for child, returns NULL
- **Critical:** Must still wait for child to prevent zombie process

#### 6. Realloc Failures
```c
char* new_output = realloc(output, total_size);
if (new_output == NULL) {
    perror("Error: realloc failed");
    free(output);  // Free old buffer
    // Cleanup pipes and child...
    return NULL;
}
output = new_output;
```
- **Handles:** Memory expansion failure
- **Recovery:** Frees old buffer, cleans up, returns NULL
- **Important:** Old buffer still valid if realloc fails

#### 7. Client Disconnection
```c
if (bytes_received <= 0) {
    if (bytes_received == 0) {
        printf("[INFO] Client disconnected.\n");
    } else {
        perror("Error: recv failed");
    }
    break;
}
```
- **Handles:** Graceful disconnect (0) vs. error (-1)
- **Recovery:** Exit command loop, close connection

### Edge Cases Handled

#### 1. Commands with Large Output
- **Problem:** Output exceeds initial buffer size
- **Solution:** Dynamic buffer reallocation (doubles size as needed)
- **Test:** `ls -la /usr/bin` (hundreds of files)

#### 2. Commands with No Output
- **Problem:** Empty output string
- **Solution:** Check output length before printing, send empty string to client
- **Test:** `ls nonexistent 2> /dev/null`

#### 3. Invalid Commands
- **Problem:** Command not found
- **Solution:** Check exit status and error message, set success flag to 0
- **Test:** `unknowncmd`

#### 4. Commands with Pipes (Phase 1 Feature)
- **Problem:** Must capture output from entire pipeline
- **Solution:** Phase 1 `execute_pipeline()` handles pipes, our capture mechanism works transparently
- **Test:** `ls | grep txt`, `ps aux | grep bash`

#### 5. Commands with Redirections (Phase 1 Feature)
- **Problem:** Must respect input/output redirections
- **Solution:** Phase 1 handles redirections before our capture, works correctly
- **Test:** `cat < input.txt`, `ls > output.txt`

#### 6. Exit Command
- **Problem:** Special handling needed to close connection gracefully
- **Solution:** Check for "exit" string, send empty response, break loop
- **Test:** Type `exit` in client

#### 7. Multiple Sequential Commands
- **Problem:** Server must handle multiple commands in one session
- **Solution:** Command loop continues until exit or disconnect
- **Test:** Run multiple commands without reconnecting

## Execution Instructions

### Compilation

#### Build Server Only
```bash
make server
```

#### Build All (Server + Phase 1 Shell)
```bash
make all
```

#### Clean and Rebuild
```bash
make clean
make server
```

### Running the Server

#### Start Server
```bash
./server
```

**Expected Output:**
```
[INFO] Server started, waiting for client connections...
```

The server will now block, waiting for a client to connect on port 8080.

#### Server Output During Operation

When a client connects and executes commands, you'll see:
```
[INFO] Client connected.
[RECEIVED] Received command: "ls -l" from client.
[EXECUTING] Executing command: "ls -l"
[OUTPUT] Sending output to client:
total 12
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 1234 Feb 27 12:00 file1.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 5678 Feb 27 12:05 file2.txt
[RECEIVED] Received command: "unknowncmd" from client.
[EXECUTING] Executing command: "unknowncmd"
[ERROR] Command not found: "unknowncmd"
[OUTPUT] Sending error message to client:
Error: Command not found: unknowncmd
[RECEIVED] Received command: "exit" from client.
[INFO] Client requested exit.
```

### Stopping the Server

#### Normal Shutdown
- Wait for client to send "exit" command
- Server will close connection and exit

#### Force Stop
```bash
# Press Ctrl+C in the server terminal
^C
```

### Testing Without Client (Using netcat)

Before Person B completes the client, you can test the server using `netcat`:
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start server
./server

# Terminal 2: Connect with netcat
nc localhost 8080

# Type commands:
ls
pwd
ps
exit
```

### Testing Without Client (Using telnet)

Alternatively, use `telnet`:
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start server
./server

# Terminal 2: Connect with telnet
telnet localhost 8080

# Type commands and press Enter
ls
pwd
exit
```

### Port Conflicts

If you see `Error: Bind failed: Address already in use`:
```bash
# Check what's using port 8080
lsof -i :8080

# Kill the process (if it's an old server instance)
kill <PID>

# Or use a different port (requires code modification)
```

### Running on Remote Server

If testing on a remote Linux server:
```bash
# Start server
./server

## Challenges

### Challenge 1: Output Capture Mechanism

**Problem:**  
Initially, it was unclear how to capture the output from Phase 1 command execution. The Phase 1 code writes directly to stdout using `printf()`, and we needed to intercept this output to send it over the socket to the client.

**Attempted Solutions:**
1. **First Attempt - Using `system()`:**
   - Tried using `system()` to execute commands
   - **Issue:** Cannot capture output easily
   - **Abandoned**

2. **Second Attempt - Redirecting to temporary files:**
```c
   system("ls > temp_output.txt");
   // Read file and send to client
```
   - **Issue:** Slow due to file I/O
   - **Issue:** Race conditions with multiple clients (future phase)
   - **Issue:** Doesn't integrate with Phase 1 code
   - **Abandoned**

**Final Solution:**  
Implemented pipe-based output capture with `fork()` and `dup2()`:
1. Create pipes before forking
2. In child: redirect stdout/stderr to pipes using `dup2()`
3. In child: execute Phase 1 code normally (it writes to "stdout" which is now the pipe)
4. In parent: read from pipes to capture all output
5. Parent waits for child to complete

**Why This Works:**
- Phase 1 code remains completely unchanged
- All output (including from pipes, redirections, etc.) is captured
- No file I/O overhead
- Works with any command output size (dynamic buffer)

**Time Spent:** ~3 hours researching and implementing

**Lessons Learned:**
- `dup2()` is powerful for transparent file descriptor redirection
- Pipes are the standard IPC mechanism for parent-child communication
- Always close unused pipe ends to avoid deadlocks

---

### Challenge 2: Dynamic Buffer Management

**Problem:**  
Commands can produce arbitrary amounts of output. Initially used a fixed 4096-byte buffer, but commands like `ls -la /usr` exceeded this, causing truncation.

**Attempted Solutions:**
1. **First Attempt - Large fixed buffer (64KB):**
   - **Issue:** Wastes memory for small outputs
   - **Issue:** Still has a maximum limit
   - **Abandoned**

**Final Solution:**  
Implemented dynamic buffer growth using `realloc()`:
- Start with 8KB buffer (BUFFER_SIZE * 2)
- When buffer fills, double the size
- Continue until all output captured
```c
while (output_len + bytes + 1 > total_size) {
    total_size *= 2;
    char* new_output = realloc(output, total_size);
    if (new_output == NULL) {
        // Handle error
    }
    output = new_output;
}
```

**Why This Works:**
- Efficient memory usage (grows only as needed)
- No hard limit on output size
- Doubling strategy keeps number of reallocations low (O(log n))

**Time Spent:** ~1 hour

**Lessons Learned:**
- Always check `realloc()` return value (can return NULL)
- If `realloc()` fails, original pointer is still valid
- Doubling strategy is standard for dynamic arrays

---

### Challenge 3: Child Process Management

**Problem:**  
After forking to execute commands, needed to properly wait for child processes to avoid zombie processes. Also had to handle cases where child process fails.

**Issues Encountered:**
- Forgot to call `waitpid()` → zombie processes accumulated
- Didn't check exit status → couldn't determine command success/failure
- Didn't close pipe descriptors in parent → file descriptor leak

**Solution:**
1. Always call `waitpid()` after reading from pipes
2. Use `WIFEXITED()` and `WEXITSTATUS()` to check exit status
3. Close all unused pipe descriptors in both parent and child
```c
int status;
waitpid(pid, &status, 0);

if (WIFEXITED(status)) {
    int exit_status = WEXITSTATUS(status);
    if (exit_status == 0) {
        *success = 1;
    } else {
        *success = 0;
    }
}
```

**Time Spent:** ~2 hours debugging zombie processes

**Lessons Learned:**
- Always wait for child processes
- Always close unused pipe ends
- Use `ps aux` to check for zombie processes during testing

---

### Challenge 4: Protocol Design

**Problem:**  
Needed to design a simple but effective protocol for client-server communication. Had to decide on message format, termination, buffering, etc.

**Considerations:**
- How to delimit messages?
- How to handle multi-line output?
- How to signal end of output?
- What buffer size is appropriate?

**Solution:**
- Commands: Newline-terminated strings
- Responses: Variable-length plain text (no delimiter)
- Client reads until server closes write or buffer fills
- Buffer size: 4096 bytes (standard page size)

**Why Simple is Better:**
- Easy to implement and debug
- Human-readable (can test with netcat/telnet)
- No serialization overhead
- Sufficient for shell commands

**Time Spent:** ~1 hour designing and documenting

**Lessons Learned:**
- Start with simplest protocol that works
- Document protocol clearly for Person B
- Test protocol with simple tools (nc, telnet) before client is ready

---

### Challenge 5: Error Handling Completeness

**Problem:**  
Many system calls can fail (socket creation, bind, accept, fork, pipe, malloc, etc.). Needed comprehensive error handling without making code unreadable.

**Approach:**
1. Check return value of every system call
2. Use `perror()` for meaningful error messages
3. Clean up resources before returning errors
4. Ensure no file descriptor leaks or memory leaks on error paths

**Example:**
```c
if (pipe(stdout_pipe) == -1) {
    perror("Error: pipe creation failed");
    *success = 0;
    return NULL;
}

if (pipe(stderr_pipe) == -1) {
    perror("Error: pipe creation failed");
    close(stdout_pipe[0]);  // Clean up first pipe
    close(stdout_pipe[1]);
    *success = 0;
    return NULL;
}
```

**Time Spent:** ~2 hours adding and testing error handling

**Lessons Learned:**
- Error handling can double code size
- Always clean up partial allocations
- Test error paths (hard to trigger, but important)

---

### Challenge 6: Integration with Phase 1 Code

**Problem:**  
Phase 1 code (shell_utils.c) was not designed to be used as a library. It expects to run in the main process with normal stdout.

**Issues:**
- Phase 1 prints errors directly to stderr
- Phase 1 uses global state in some places
- Needed to call parse_pipeline() and execute_pipeline() from child process

**Solution:**
- Let Phase 1 code run normally in child process
- Capture all output (including errors) using pipes
- No modifications to Phase 1 code needed

**Why This Works:**
- Fork creates separate process space
- Each command execution is isolated
- Output capture happens transparently

**Time Spent:** ~30 minutes verifying integration

**Lessons Learned:**
- Fork provides good isolation for library integration
- Don't modify working code if you can avoid it
- Test all Phase 1 features (pipes, redirections, etc.) through server
